description: Validate your manifest and embed configuration, then share
---

Before sharing your Mini App, validate everything works.

## Pre‑deployment checklist

- App is deployed at a public HTTPS domain
- Environment variables are set on your deployment platform
- `/.well-known/farcaster.json` returns valid JSON
- `fc:frame` metadata renders a launch button when shared

## Validation tools

- Manifest Tool: `https://farcaster.xyz/~/developers/mini-apps/manifest`
- Embed Tool: `https://farcaster.xyz/~/developers/mini-apps/embed`

## Share and test

1. Create a cast with your app’s URL
2. Verify preview and launch button
3. Test launch and frame readiness
