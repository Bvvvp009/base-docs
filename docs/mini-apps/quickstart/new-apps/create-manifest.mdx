description: Generate your Farcaster account association and expose the /.well-known/farcaster.json endpoint
---

With a stable URL, create and configure your manifest so users can save and discover your Mini App.

## Generate account association via CLI

```bash Terminal
npx create-onchain --manifest
```

<Info>
Use your Farcaster custody wallet to sign. You can import it using your recovery phrase from Farcaster (Settings â†’ Advanced).
</Info>

After signing, the CLI updates local `.env` variables:

- FARCASTER_HEADER
- FARCASTER_PAYLOAD
- FARCASTER_SIGNATURE

Review the full [Manifest guide](/mini-apps/features/manifest) and update all fields. Be sure to update your deployment environment with these values.

<Warning>
While testing, set `noindex: true` in your manifest to avoid indexing.
</Warning>

## `/.well-known/farcaster.json`

The manifest exists in `app/.well-known/farcaster.json/route.ts` which returns your accountAssociation and mini app properties. Ensure all asset URLs are HTTPS and publicly accessible.

<Check>
Open `https://yourdomain.com/.well-known/farcaster.json` in a browser to verify JSON output.
</Check>

## Add frame metadata for embeds

Define `fc:frame` metadata so your app renders a rich embed with a launch button when shared.

Review the full [Embeds and Previews](/mini-apps/features/embeds-and-previews) guide to create engaging sharing experiences and improve discoverability.

<Warning>
All image and API URLs must be publicly accessible via HTTPS.
