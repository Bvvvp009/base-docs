To create your manifest and test your Mini App, you need a live HTTPS URL.

## Deploy to Vercel (recommended)

<Steps>
<Step title="Install Vercel CLI">

```bash Terminal
npm install -g vercel
```

</Step>

<Step title="Deploy">

```bash Terminal
vercel
```

</Step>

<Step title="Set environment variables">
Use `vercel env add` or the dashboard to add:

- NEXT_PUBLIC_CDP_CLIENT_API_KEY
- NEXT_PUBLIC_URL (deployed app URL)
- NEXT_PUBLIC_IMAGE_URL (optional)
- NEXT_PUBLIC_SPLASH_IMAGE_URL (optional)
- NEXT_PUBLIC_SPLASH_BACKGROUND_COLOR (optional)

</Step>
</Steps>

Then verify your URL works in a browser and proceed to manifest creation.

## Alternative: ngrok (for local testing)

<Warning>
The paid plan is recommended. The free approval screen and rotating URLs can break the manifest.
</Warning>

1. Start your dev server:

```bash Terminal
npm run dev
```

2. Create a tunnel:

```bash Terminal
npm install -g ngrok
ngrok http 3000
```

3. Copy the HTTPS URL (e.g. `https://your-tunnel.ngrok.io`)
4. Use that URL during manifest creation
